2-D decomposition examples, with variations for different send modes.
Designed to permit running multiple methods in a simple program to
simplify comparison tests.

There are versions in C and in Fortran 2003, in code-examples-c and
code-examples-f9x respectively.

Based on the 2-d Life code, but with some changes.
